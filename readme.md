#FRC NetConsole for Ruby

This is a port of WPI's NetConsole to Ruby for the [**FIRST Robotics Competition**]("usfirst.org")

There's really nothing too cool to see here.

Uses standard in for commands, find them [here](http://touro.ligo-la.caltech.edu/~cparames/CDS/vxWorks_commands.html)

##Installation


##Configuration
Set the variable `TEAM` to your FRC team number.

It looks like this

```
TEAM = 1073
```

Also, it should be four digits, if you're less than 4 digits, prefix your number with zeroes. Team 161 would look like this

```
TEAM = 0161
```
